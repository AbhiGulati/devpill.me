As far as blockchain development goes, most of the logic that traditional applications would consider backend is encapsulated within smart contracts, however, there are also complementary technologies that allow you to query data from blockchains, index the data, create databases so that you have on-demand data from custom APIs, decentralized storage for content, user authentication / DID, etc. I wouldn't consider this its own specialization, but it is a sufficiently unique skill set for me to cover it separately.

This image was created by my fren [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3) who is a full-stack blockchain developer that has created many useful guides, some of which I'll feature in the full-stack development section. This web3 stack landscape graphic comes from a recent blog post of his called [The complete guide to full-stack web3 development](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-web3-development-4g74).
