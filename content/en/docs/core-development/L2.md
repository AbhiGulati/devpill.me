Layer-2 scales Layer-1 by increasing capacity without significantly changing the security assumptions of the Layer-2.
Although this does not change L1 itself, it does influence the general scaling design direction,
generally pushing ethereum into a [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698).
