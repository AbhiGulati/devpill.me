As the name implies, full-stack blockchain development is the closest specialization to being a jack of all trades. It involves building out all of the aspects of an application from front end, to smart contracts, to backend (at least to a certain degree). This is the most generic role that most blockchain developers will take and most companies and DAOs are looking for in a contributor. Since there is such a high demand for quality developers in the space, it is oftentimes the case that employers onboard people from different fields and turn them into a jack of all trades within web3 development so as to save costs and reduce HR resource requirements (which are incredibly scarce nowadays).

Since rewriting the [front end](), [back end]() and [smart contract]() sections would be pointless, I'll dedicate this section just to list a bunch of full-stack guides, tips and tricks, deployment guidelines, project management, and other relevant information.
