If you want to contribute, please join [this Telegram group](https://t.me/devpillme) that I created for collaborators so that we can better coordinate and distribute tasks. Eventually we will migrate to a more suitable Discord/Forum setup.

The process to contribute is as follows:
1. Consult about contribution on Telegram group
2. Submit issue on the main repo with what needs to be done
3. Fork the repo
4. Create a branch with a descriptive name
5. Write contributions
6. Create pull request to main repo with given branch and reference the issue in the PR message and who has worked on it (for more people if applicable). 
7. Notify [@dcbuild3r](https://twitter.com/DCbuild3r) or admins within the Telegram group to review PR, alternatively ping in PR message by tagging.
