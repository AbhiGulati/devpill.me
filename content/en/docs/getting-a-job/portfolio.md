In order to become a good job candidate, it is almost imperative to have a portfolio of projects that you've built in order to showcase the skills you have, the technologies you use and your thought processes behind solving different problems. I.e. if you are interested in building DeFi applications then you can showcase that by writing a demo of an AMM, a yield aggregator, a money market, etc. The more high quality demo projects you have the better as these will act as valuable information for teams looking to hire. The most popular way to showcase your projects is to publish them publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

If you don't know what to build you can look at different problems different projects are facing, try solving one of them and publishing the solution as a public repo on GitHub. You can build demo projects from sites like [SpeedRunEthereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) using templates like scaffold-eth, and much more.
