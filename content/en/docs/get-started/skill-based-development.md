Now we get down to different specializations, before getting started looking at different paths you can take make sure you've gone through the [get started section](https://www.devpill.me/docs/get-started/introduction/). I also suggest reading the introduction to each specialization in both the skill-based development and application-based development categories so that you have a better idea of what's out there and what you might find interesting before going deeper into any specifical one. This section will focus on categorizing specializations in blockchain development with regard to the skillsets required within them.
