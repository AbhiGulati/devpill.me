The next and final step to get started with blockchain development should be obvious by now, it is to actually start building! After you've gone through the introductory foundational material that I wrote in the sections above you are ready to get going with one of the specializations listed below. If you are not sure which one you're into yet, just go with full-stack blockchain development and you'll get to try a bit of everything! Start writing code, no matter how bad it is, and try to get feedback on it from devs that know more than you do. Go through the roadmap that I have specified below, learn a concept, take notes, build something around it, do some testing and move on. If there is something that catches your attention, then try building something with it and see where it takes you. Your own curiosity and interest are your best friend when learning blockchain development. You should constantly ask yourself why did the thing that I wrote worked and how I could make it better, if you can't come up with an answer you either ask someone for an explanation or for a code review. It is also good to review quality code written by other teams. If you are learning Solidity, for example, the best way to learn advanced Solidity is to read into production codebases like Aave v3, Uniswap v3, Balancer v2, etc. The same principle applies to other categories and specializations as well.

Once you build something, share it with the world (unless it's a very profitable MEV bot)! Sharing it on Twitter and different Discords will bring attention to what you're doing and you might get constructive feedback and/or meet new friends that are interested in what you are building. If you are building something more complex, try creating documentation for it or make some useful comments if you expect other people to read your code. It is also great to share code and make it publicly available on hosting platforms like GitHub to build a portfolio of projects which you can showcase in order to show other people when applying for job positions. I'll revisit how to get employment in web3 in a later section.
