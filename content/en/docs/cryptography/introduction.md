Cryptography is the backbone of distributed ledgers. No distributed permissionless system is possible without asymmetric cryptography. If you are interested in building decentralized applications, it's essential to understand the wallet generation and transaction signing processes. Both of which rely heavily on underlying cryptographic protocols. Throughout this section, I provide a wide array of information about cryptography.

DISCLAIMER: While playing with these algorithms on your own is a great way to learn, you NEVER want to use your cryptographic protocols in a production environment. The existing libraries have been well-vetted and battle-tested over many years. Because cryptography is complex by design, attempting to build your cryptographic protocols is incredibly dangerous.
